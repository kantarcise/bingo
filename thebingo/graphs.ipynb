    "• In an **adjacency list**, we maintain, for each vertex, a separate list containing those edges that are incident to the vertex. The complete set of edges can be determined by taking the union of the smaller sets, while the organization allows us to more efficiently find all edges incident to a given vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "• An **adjacency map** is very similar to an adjacency list, but the secondary container of all edges incident to a vertex is organized as a map, rather than as a list, with the adjacent vertex serving as a key. This allows for access to a specific edge $(u, v)$ in $O(1)$ expected time.\n",

    "### Adjacency List Structure 💚\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the edge list representation of a graph, the adjacency list structure groups the edges of a graph by storing them in smaller, secondary containers that are associated with each individual vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for each vertex v, we maintain a collection I(v), called the incidence collection of v, whose entries are edges incident to v. (In the case of a directed graph, outgoing and incoming edges can be\n",
    "respectively stored in two separate collections, $I_{out}(v)$ and $I_{in}(v)$.) Traditionally, the incidence collection I(v) for a vertex v is a list, which is why we call this way of representing a graph the adjacency list structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary **benefit** of an ==adjacency list== is that the collection $I(v)$ contains exactly those edges that should be reported by the method `incident_edges(v)`. Therefore, we can implement this method by iterating the edges of $I(v)$ in $O(deg(v))$ time, where $deg(v)$ is the degree of vertex v. This is the best possible outcome for any graph representation, because there are $deg(v)$ edges to be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance:\n",
    " \n",
    "Asymptotically, the space requirements for an adjacency list are the same as an edge list structure, using $O(n + m)$ space for a graph with n vertices and m edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary list of vertices uses $O(n)$ space.  The sum of the lengths of all secondary lists is $O(m)$, for reasons that were formalized in Propositions 14.8 and 14.9. In short, an undirected edge (u, v) is referenced in both $I(u)$ and $I(v)$, but its presence in the graph results in only a constant amount of additional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already noted that the `incident_edges(v)` method can be achieved in $O(deg(v))$ time based on use of $I(v)$. We can achieve the `degree(v)` method of the graph ADT to use $O(1)$ time, assuming collection $I(v)$ can report its size in similar time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To locate a specific edge for implementing `get_edge(u,v)`, we can search through either $I(u)$ and $I(v)$. By choosing the smaller of the two, we get $O(min(deg(u), deg(v)))$ running time."

    "In the adjacency list structure, we assume that the secondary incidence collections are implemented as unordered linked lists. Such a collection $I(v)$ uses space proportional to $O(deg(v))$, allows an edge to be added or removed in $O(1)$ time, and allows an iteration of all edges incident to vertex v in $O(deg(v))$ time. \n",

    "We can improve the performance by using a hash-based map to implement $I(v)$ for each vertex v. Specifically, we let the opposite endpoint of each incident edge serve as a key in the map, with the edge structure serving as the value. We call such a graph representation an adjacency map.

    "The adjacency matrix structure for a graph G augments the edge list structure with a matrix A (that is, a two-dimensional array, as in Chapter 5.6), which allows us to locate an edge between a given pair of vertices in worst-case constant time. In the adjacency matrix representation, we think of the vertices as being the integers in the set ${0, 1, . . . , n − 1}$ and the edges as being pairs of such integers. This allows\n",

    "\n",
    "The most significant advantage of an adjacency matrix is that any edge (u, v) can be accessed in worst-case $O(1)$ time; recall that the adjacency map supports that operation in $O(1)$ expected time. However, several operation are less efficient with an adjacency matrix. For example, to find the edges incident to vertex v, we must presumably examine all n entries in the row associated with v; recall that an adjacency list or map can locate those edges in optimal $O(deg(v))$ time. Adding or removing vertices from a graph is problematic, as the matrix must be resized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the $O(n^2)$ space usage of an adjacency matrix is typically far worse than the $O(n + m)$ space required of the other representations. Although, in the worst case, the number of edges in a dense graph will be proportional to $n^2$ , most real-world graphs are sparse."
