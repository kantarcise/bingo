    "Two-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) is a technique used to solve optimization problems where the solution depends on `two parameters`, `states`, or `variables`. \n",
    "\n",
    "It extends the concept of one-dimensional dynamic programming to problems with two dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some problems, there is a dependency between two parameters or variables, and optimizing one depends on the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two-dimensional dynamic programming allows us to capture these dependencies and find the optimal solution by considering both dimensions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with nested structures or hierarchies often lend themselves to a two-dimensional dynamic programming approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, problems involving grids, matrices, or trees may require a two-dimensional approach to efficiently compute optimal solutions."

    "A state is usually defined as the particular condition that \n",
    "something is in at a specific point of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in terms of Dynamic Programming, a state is \n",
    "defined by a number of necessary variables at a particular \n",
    "instant that are required to calculate the optimal result. \n",
    "So, basically it is a combination of variables that will keep \n",

    "more is the depth of the recursive solution and more is the \n",
    "memory required to cache the result of the states to avoid re-computing. \n",

    "This is because, you are most likely to have the same state at some \n",

    "Answer: Index and Current Sum\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Index? \n",
    "\n",
    "Index represents the index of the input subset we \n",

    "Question: What decisions do we have to make at each recursive call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: As a general rule, Knapsack problems will require 2 decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: This problem requires we take ALL items in our input subset, \n",
    "so at every step we will be adding an item to our knapsack. Remember, \n",
    "we stated in Step 2 that \"The question asks us if we can sum every \n",
    "item (either the positive or negative value of that item) in the \n",
    "subset to reach the target value.\" The decision is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Should we add the current numbers positive value\n",
    "Should we add the current numbers negative value\n",

    "items, thus a usual knapsack decision is to take the item or leave the item.\n",

    "\n",
    "Base cases need to relate directly to the conditions required by \n",
