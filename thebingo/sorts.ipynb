    "### Why is stable sorting important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted is stable and indeed that it uses exactly the same algorithm as the sort method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal â€” this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a list of people with their ages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "people = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 20},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, if we want to sort this list by age using a stable sort, the original order of people with the same age should be preserved. In this case, both Alice and Charlie are 25 years old, and Bob and Eve are 30 years old. If we use a stable sort, the sorted list would maintain the order of people with the same age as they appear in the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can achieve this in Python using the sorted function with a custom key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the list of people\n",
    "people = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"David\", \"age\": 20},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 30},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort the list of people by age using a stable sort\n",
    "sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda x: x[\"age\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the sorted list\n",
    "for person in sorted_people:\n",
    "    print(person[\"name\"], person[\"age\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "David 20\n",
    "Alice 25\n",
    "Charlie 25\n",
    "Bob 30\n",
    "Eve 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Alice and Charlie, who are both 25 years old, appear in the sorted list in the same order as they appeared in the original list. This demonstrates the concept of stable sorting, where the relative order of equal elements is preserved."
