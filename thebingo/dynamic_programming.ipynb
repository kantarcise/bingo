    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the dynamic programming technique is used primarily for optimization problems, where we wish to ﬁnd the “best” way of doing something. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply the dynamic programming technique in such situations if the problem has certain properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Subproblems: \n",
    "- There has to be some way of repeatedly breaking the global optimization problem into subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, there should be a way to parameterize subproblems with just a few indices, like i, j, k, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subproblem Optimization: \n",

    "## Chat-GPT Wisdom\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant work. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially useful when a problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and benefits of dynamic programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Substructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "This property means that an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.\n",
    "In the matrix chain multiplication problem, the optimal way to multiply a sequence of matrices involves the optimal multiplication of its subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlapping Subproblems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming avoids redundant computation by solving subproblems only once and storing their solutions in a table or cache.\n",
    "In the matrix chain multiplication problem, there are repeated calculations when considering different subsequences, which can be avoided using dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memoization and Tabulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabulation involves filling a table with the results of subproblems and using those results to build up to the solution of the overall problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization**: Dynamic programming often leads to more efficient solutions by avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplicity**: It can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability**: Dynamic programming solutions are often more readable and intuitive than alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Dynamic Programming Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Substructure:  If a problem can be broken down into smaller independent subproblems and the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems, it may be suitable for dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlapping Subproblems: If the problem involves solving the same subproblems multiple times, dynamic programming can help by avoiding redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns:\n",
    "Dynamic programming problems often exhibit one of two common patterns: bottom-up (tabulation) or top-down (memoization). The matrix chain multiplication code you provided is an example of the bottom-up approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify when to use dynamic programming, consider whether the problem can be decomposed into overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure. If these characteristics are present, dynamic programming might be a powerful approach to solving the problem."

    "### Fibonacci Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a technique used in computer science and mathematics to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is particularly useful when a problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the classic example of calculating the nth Fibonacci number to illustrate dynamic programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(0)=0$ $F(1)=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without dynamic programming, a straightforward recursive solution to calculate the nth Fibonacci number might look like this in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci_recursive(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, let's analyze the time complexity of this naive recursive solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is exponential, roughly $o(2^n)$. This is because for each Fibonacci number, the function makes two recursive calls, leading to an exponential number of calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exponential time complexity - Oh no 😮\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how dynamic programming can significantly improve the efficiency of this solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use memoization to store the results of previously solved subproblems and avoid redundant computations. Here's a simple dynamic programming solution using memoization in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci_dp(n, memo={}):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if n not in memo:\n",
    "        memo[n] = fibonacci_dp(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_dp(n-2, memo)\n",
    "    return memo[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution, the memo dictionary is used to store the results of already computed Fibonacci numbers. If a Fibonacci number is already in the memo, it is directly returned, preventing the need for redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "Now, let's compare the two approaches for calculating $F(5)$ using both the naive recursive approach and the dynamic programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic programming solution is much more efficient, especially for larger values of n. The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is $O(n)$ due to the memoization, making it exponentially faster than the naive recursive approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the power of dynamic programming in optimizing solutions to problems with overlapping subproblems, and it is a fundamental technique in algorithm design."
