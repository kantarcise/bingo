    "    Here are some tips for using the sliding window \n",
    "        algorithm to solve problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Identify the condition that the substring must satisfy. \n",
    "    This is the most important step, as it will determine how \n",
    "    the algorithm is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Initialize the sliding window. The sliding window can be \n",
    "    initialized to be any size, but it is generally a good idea \n",
    "    to start with a small window and then increase the size of the\n",
    "     window as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Check whether the sliding window satisfies the condition.\n",
    "    This is the core of the sliding window algorithm. If the sliding\n",
    "    window satisfies the condition, then the algorithm has found a\n",
    "    substring that satisfies the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Update the sliding window. The sliding window can be updated by \n",
    "    either incrementing the left pointer or the right pointer.\n",
    "     Incrementing the left pointer will remove the leftmost character \n",
    "     from the window, while incrementing the right pointer will add \n",
    "     the next character to the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Repeat the process until the end of the string is reached. The \n",
    "    algorithm should continue to iterate over the string until it reaches\n",
    "     the end of the string. If the algorithm has not found a substring\n",
