    "- Start at a designated starting node (the \"source\" node).\n",

    "\n",

    "    b. Process the popped node (e.g., print it, add it to a result list, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Push all the unvisited neighbors of the popped node onto the stack (or make recursive calls for each unvisited neighbor).\n",
