    "- Start at a designated starting vertex (the \"source\" vertex).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Push the source vertex onto a stack (or use recursion).\n",

    "- While the stack is not empty (or the recursion hasn't completed):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Pop a vertex from the stack (or use the current vertex in the recursion).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Process the popped vertex (e.g., print it, add it to a result list, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Push all the unvisited neighbors of the popped vertex onto the stack (or make recursive calls for each unvisited neighbor).\n",
