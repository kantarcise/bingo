    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors at the present depth before moving on to the neighbors at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the BFS algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start at a designated starting node (the \"source\" node).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mark the source node as visited and enqueue it into a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Process the dequeued node (e.g., print it, add it to a result list, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeat steps 3 until the queue is empty.\n",
